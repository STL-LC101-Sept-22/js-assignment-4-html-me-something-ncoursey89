               <h2>Purpose</h2>
               <p>The purpose of this webpage is to tell a story that links the winding path of my career. As Richard Bolles states in his widely circulated book <em>What Color is Your Parachute?</em>, &quot;a <em>job</em> is a <em>job-title</em> in a <em>field</em>.&quot;<a href = "#(1)">(1)</a> Sound advice. Taking this a step further, I believe each job of mine has been a bridge <b>spanning</b> two (or more) fields. When I am in the job market, it is up to me to strongly advocate how my current job and field(s) (or previous job and fields) makes me the person to hire. This is how I went from a market analyst at a 10-person urban planning consulting firm to working as a financial planning analyst at one of the largest medical insurance companies in the U.S., and how that current job and the coursework I am doing at LaunchCode are helping to chart the course for my career moving forward.</p>

                  Inquisitive and analytical, I spent my undergraduate years at <a href = https://www.lindenwood.edu>Lindenwood University</a> as a political science/pre-law major, bent on changing the world. While initially interested in law school, an internship with the <a href = https://www.stcecodev.com>City of Saint Charles, Missouri Economic Development Department</a> between my junior and senior years contributed to a decision to enroll in a graduate degree program in urban planning at <a href = https://planning.gatech.edu> Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. This meshed my interests in public service with a passion for design and the urban form. Shortly after graduating, I was hired by Development Strategies, a consulting firm in St. Louis focusing on urban planning and real estate analysis. I became skilled in market research and analysis, working on a team with other planners and licensed real estate appraisers for clients that ranged from real estate developers to commercial and investment banks to local and regional governments.

                     While at Development Strategies, my interests shifted more towards real estate and market analysis, and I took night classes in order to complete an MBA with an emphasis in finance at <a href = https://www.lindenwood.edu>Lindenwood University</a> . With my newly minted MBA, I wanted to use my experience within a real estate consulting firm and the knowledge base from both my urban planning and finance degrees to get a job as a financial analyst within the real estate industry. A position opened up in the Capital Markets department at Altus Properties, a local private equity real estate investment firm. While the work had a larger corporate communications component than I desired, it was the industry experience I was wanting, and I gained valuable experience in Excel.

                     My position at Altus overlapped with some big changes, both in my personal life and within the world at large, which ultimately set me on my current course. COVID-19 changed the way we worked, and I worked fully remote for over a year while employed by a commercial office asset manager. After working two jobs at smaller firms, I desired to work for a larger company in a more analytical space. I wanted to utilize the Excel chops I continued to develop at Altus without having to spend half of my day on presentation slides and pitch scripts. A larger firm would also grant me exposure to databases, something I had limited exposure to. I needed a change, but I didn't know what, and getting married was a good time for a sabbatical to help with the decision. It was during this time that I first started to code, taking some JavaScript courses through Codecademy and starting a data analytics bootcamp through Springboard. I enjoyed this experience, and decided I was going to try to pivot into the software development or data analytics space. 
                     Recharged with the career pivot in mind, I was ready to start my job search for something that could help me “in the gap.” A way to tie my past work with where I wanted to go. A job opened up within the Marketplace Financial Planning team at Centene. I could leverage my finance background and excel skills to get a job at a larger company. As a bonus, the department heavily utilizes data pulls from a relational database, and I was onboarded during the later stages of a major IT project to transition the relational database used by the larger organization.

               <p id = testP class = funParagraph>
                  Shortly after starting at Centene, I was accepted into <a href = https://www.launchcode.org/web-development>LC101</a>, a part-time intensive software development bootcamp through <a href = https://www.launchcode.org>LaunchCode</a>, a non profit with a solid reputation in the local business community. While I am unsure of exactly where my career will go next, I believe there are ways to harness the work experience I have had so far and combine this with my new coding skills. A lateral move into an IT department at Centene, where I already know the company culture and healthcare space makes sense. But I could also leverage my experience in other fields to land that first development job.
